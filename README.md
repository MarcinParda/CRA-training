# Create React App training projects
## Git repo to keep all my training projects in one place
### Every commit is one small project. Why this way?
My internet connection and computer itself are slow, so command `npx create-react-app` takes a long time. Copying CRA files also takes a long time (25 min). So I override my project with new commits. This repo is only backup for my projects.
